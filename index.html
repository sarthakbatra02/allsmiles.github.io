<h2 id="what">Whats Inside</h2>
<p>A decision is required every day between what you have become accustomed to and something you desire to have … once the decision is implemented it takes you farther than from whence you made the decision.</p><br>
<p>No matter what you achieve, what you want to aspire to be, or how famous and powerful you become, the most important thing is whether you are excited about each and every moment of your life because of your work and people around you.</p>

<h2 id="about">About The Author</h2>
<p>Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show. To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at night.</p>
